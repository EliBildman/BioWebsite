# BioWebsite
Node.js portfolio website

This project is end-of-life'd. The stack I used is outdated and some of the fundemental orgization is kind of unworkable.

## Commands:

```bash
npm run start
```
Run the server on localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```
Run the server on localhost:3000 in develop mode (relaunches on changes)
